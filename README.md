# Oblong

_A pretty boring vscode theme._

## Description

- Syntax highlighting that only differentiates between string literals, number 
   literals, keywords, storage modifiers and comments.
- Muted colours for the code.
- High contrast green for comments.

## Notes

- Still a work in progress. A lot of the workspace UI elements haven't been changed yet.
- Feel free to make a PR if you notice language specific tokens that haven't been
  covered. I have been updating it as I go while programming in C/C++, C# and 
  TypeScript.
